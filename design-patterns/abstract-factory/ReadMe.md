Abstract Factory Design Pattern is one of the Creational pattern and almost similar to Factory Method Pattern except because itâ€™s more like a factory of factories. In the Factory Method Pattern, we have a single factory class that returns the different sub-classes based on the input provided.

Abstract Factory Design Pattern is used when we have two or more objects which works together forming a kit/set and there can be multiple sets or kits that can be created by client code. We separate client code from these concrete objects forming such a set and also from the code that creates such a set.

Abstract Factory Design Pattern implementation provides us a framework that allows us to create objects that follow a general pattern. So at runtime, the abstract factory is coupled with any desired concrete factory that can create objects of the desired type.

Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a super-factory that creates other factories. It offers the interface for creating a family of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes.
